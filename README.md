# Data analysis project
This repository contains my experience in data science through analysis of real world data, focussing primarily on data visualization, extraction of relevant insights to answer business queries and story-telling through data visualization. Currently, there are two projects involving these activities: 
1. **Zomato Delhi**: This project is all about analysing various features determining the commercial success of restaurants in Delhi, which have tie-up with Zomato. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and contains a wide range of restaurant with different specialities, price-range and rating points. Through this project, a broad understanding of certain important features like price range, rating points and the number of restaurants within particular categories is attained.

2. **Air Quality Index** : The second project is focussed on analysis of air quality in various states of India and is developed from scratch. At first the air quality data containing thedifferent pollutant levels in each recording station is extracted from www.opendata.gov.in JSON format. After doing the necessary processing, the data is converted to CSV and a relevant dataframe is prepared. This dataframe however, requires substantial cleaning before any analysis.

4However, this data has a missing component i.e the actual air quality index value for all measuring station. Hence, the latter is separately obtained from https://app.cpcbccr.com/AQI_India/ first in an excel file and then converted to csv format. The relevant column from this data is then merged with the former to obtain the final dataset for analysis.
5. The above data is updated in real time within every one hour
